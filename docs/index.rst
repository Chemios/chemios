Welcome to Chemios!
===================================

 The Chemios Framework is a simple, open-source (i.e. FREE) software package for laboratory automation and monitoring. It is easy-to-use and extensible. It currently works with pumps, spectrometers and temperature controllers; more devices will be added to the roadmap based on feedback from users.

 The framework is written in python (the unoffical language of science) and actively maintained. It works with pumps, spectrometers and more.
