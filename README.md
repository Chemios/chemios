 **Chemios Framework** â€” Automate your laboratory through an easy-to-use software package.
 
 The Chemios Framework takes care of the idiosyncrancies of interfacing with pumps, reactors and more, so you can make discoveries quicker.

 The framework is written in python (the unoffical language of science), made open-source and is actively maintained.

Please, do not push substantial changes directly to master (a substantial change is anything besides updating a README or docstring). Instead, create a branch in the format `your_name-feature`. So, if Kobi is working on a feature called foo, his branch would be `kobi-foo`. Then, submit a merge request (same as a pull request on Github) and assigned it to @marcos_felt.
